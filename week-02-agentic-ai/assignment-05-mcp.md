# Assignment 5 — Connecting Claude to the Outside World

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will connect Claude Code to external systems using MCP (Model Context Protocol). You will configure the GitHub MCP server, securely store credentials, verify the connection, and run a live query that proves Claude is accessing real-time GitHub data.

---

# Task 1 — Create a GitHub Personal Access Token

## Goal

Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) that will be used for MCP authentication.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — GitHub token creation page showing the selected scopes (`repo`, `read:user`) — token value must NOT be visible

---

# Task 2 — Create .mcp.json at the Project Root

## Goal

Create and configure the `.mcp.json` file to define the GitHub MCP server.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — `.mcp.json` open in VS Code showing the full configuration

# Task 3 — Add Your Token to settings.local.json

## Goal

Store your GitHub token securely in `.claude/settings.local.json` and ensure it is not committed to version control.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — `settings.local.json` open in VS Code showing the `env` section — **blur or cover the actual GitHub token value**

---

# Task 4 — Verify the Connection with /mcp

## Goal

Confirm that the GitHub MCP server is successfully connected inside Claude Code.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — `/mcp` output showing `github: connected`

---

# Task 5 — Run a Live GitHub Query

## Goal

Verify MCP functionality by retrieving real-time data from your GitHub account using Claude Code.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — Claude's response showing the GitHub MCP tool call and the retrieved README.md content.
