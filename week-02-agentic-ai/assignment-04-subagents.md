# Assignment 4 — Building Your AI Team

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build and configure a set of specialized AI subagents inside your project. You will learn how different models and tool permissions define agent behavior, and you will trigger two real agent delegations to analyze security and cost aspects of your Terraform infrastructure.

# Task 1 — Create the Agents Folder and Add Files

## Goal

Create the `.claude/agents/` directory and add all required agent files.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — VS Code sidebar showing `.claude/agents/` with all 3 files

# Task 2 — Compare the Agent Configurations

## Goal

Analyze the configuration differences between the three agents and demonstrate understanding of model and tool selection.

### Written Answers

#### 1. Why does the cost optimizer use Haiku instead of Sonnet?

The cost optimizer uses Haiku because cost-analysis tasks generally do not require the more advanced reasoning capabilities of Sonnet. Haiku is a faster and more cost-efficient model that is suitable for analyzing infrastructure usage, identifying potential savings, and making straightforward optimization recommendations.

---

#### 2. Why does the security auditor NOT have Write in its tools list?

The security auditor is intended to inspect and analyze the project rather than modify it. Removing the Write tool prevents the agent from changing files while performing a security review, which helps make the audit read-only and reduces the risk of unintended modifications.

---

#### 3. Why does the tf-writer use `inherit` instead of a specific model?

inherit allows the tf-writer agent to use the model configured for the current Claude Code session instead of forcing a specific model. This makes the agent flexible and allows its model capability to follow the user's active configuration.

# Task 3 — Run the Security Auditor

## Goal

Trigger the security auditor agent and analyze the generated security report for your Terraform infrastructure.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — The delegation message showing Claude launched the security-auditor

# Task 4 — Run the Cost Optimizer

## Goal

Trigger the cost optimizer agent and review the generated cost optimization report.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — The full cost optimization report
