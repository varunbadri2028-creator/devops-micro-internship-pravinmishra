# Assignment 3 — Building Your Command Center

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build a local Claude Skills system by creating the `.claude/skills/` folder structure, adding predefined skill files, and executing a real agentic command (`/scaffold-terraform`) to generate infrastructure code. You will also observe how skills enforce tool restrictions and enable controlled automation.

# Task 1 — Create the Skill Folder Structure

## Goal

Create the required `.claude/skills/` directory structure for all skills.

### Evidence

# Task 2 — Add the Skill Files

## Goal

Place all required skill files into their correct directories and verify their configuration.

# Task 4 — Run terraform init and /tf-plan

## Goal

Initialize Terraform and execute the `/tf-plan` skill to observe plan execution and output analysis.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Claude's `/tf-plan` response showing it ran the command and analyzed the result (pass or auth error both count)
